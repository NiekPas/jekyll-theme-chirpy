This website — I hestitate to call it a blog — is written and maintained by me, Niek van de Pas. I am a student of Social Cultural Science at Radboud University in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, with a background in Anthropology and Development Sociology. My interests pertain primarily to the variety of social life and how to study it[^social], listening to and composing music[^music], computer science and (primarily Apple-related) technologies[^tech], and productivity and mental health[^productivity].

[^social]: Two of my favorite works of social theory are David Graeber's "The Utopia of Rules" and Daniel Miller's "Stuff".
[^music]: Recently found the album [What Kinda Music](https://open.spotify.com/album/6iOCv7oGL5sGi2aVnRz2BI?si=29cb0dfea23d46e0) by Tom Misch and Yussef Dayes.
[^tech]: I am an avid listener of the [Accidental Tech Podcast](http://atp.fm).
[^productivity]: For productivity, [Cortex](http://relay.fm/cortex) is a great podcast.

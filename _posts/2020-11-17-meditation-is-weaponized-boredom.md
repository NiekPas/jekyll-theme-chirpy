## A what and a why
Brains need time to process what is occurring. In modern society, this time is rare: inputs are everywhere, both controllable (entertainment and work) and uncontrollable (other people, advertisements). A constant stream of inputs leads to a tired mind. A tired mind requires downtime, to process all that has happened. This is boredom, or The neutral state of your brain. When the brain is done processing, boredom stops, and the brain finds itself engaged it activities once again.

I believe that safeguarding your brain from inputs is an essential task for residents of modern societies. One of the best and most common ways to do so is to get up, go outside, and take a walk or go for a bike ride. These activities engage the body, which has its own set of benefits, and allow the mind to decompress. This is why you find yourself mulling things over when you're out and about: there isn't much else to do.

Another way to safeguard your brain from inputs is meditation, which is what I'd like to talk about here. Meditation is a set of many different practices; proponents of meditation claim that it provides various benefits. Many of these are described in vague terms, such as "understanding that you are not your thoughts". I also meditate, because I believe it is a form of weaponized boredom. It brings the cognitive and mental benefits of a 30-60 minute walk in a 15-20 minute meditation session. **When I finish meditating, I generally feel more restful (i.e. less anxious), more confident and self-assured, happier, calmer, and more energized.**

This is not to say that meditation is the solution to all problems. However, it helps to de-clutter the mind, which makes everything that is required to function in a day easier.

So how does one meditate? It can be done in many ways. Personally, I engage in a modified form of Transcendental Meditation (TM). TM is somewhat famous both due to the fame of some of its proponents, such as Jerry Seinfeld, David Lynch and Jon Hopkins, as well as due to its — in my view, fraudulent — $1000 lessons. You do not need a $1000 lesson to practice some form of effective meditation.
## A brief how-to
So what _do_ you need? This depends on your personality, but the following is what works for me, and what I recommend:
- **An absence of disturbances**. This seems non-negotiable to me. If you live with people, tell them not to disturb you for the coming 15-20 minutes, or hang something on your door to indicate so. Remember to turn on Do Not Disturb on your phone, and to mute any other devices around you.
- **A chair** with a back rest. I use my desk chair. Any chair will do, as long it is comfortable enough. A back rest is helpful, since it means you won't need to focus on your balance.
- A pair of **headphones**. I use the Bose QuietComfort 35, because they are noise-canceling, but that is not a requirement. If you are in a noisy environment, I recommend putting in earplugs (if you have them) and putting headphones at a loud volume over them. This allows you to drown out the noise around you without damaging your ears.
- A **sleep mask**. Blocking out the incoming light helps me in keeping my eyes closed. I recommend the [Manta Sleep Mask](https://mantasleep.com/products/manta-sleep-mask); it is expensive, but completely dark, and very comfortable.
- Some form of **music or audio**. Not everybody puts on music while meditating, and you don't have to. I prefer it. I listen to one of two things: Jon Hopkins' "1/1 Singing Bowl (Ascension)", or [his playlist "Quiet"](https://www.google.com/search?q=jon+hopkins+quiet+playlist). Both are specifically geared to meditation and Psychedelic experiences. If you want to use a different song or playlist, feel free. I recommend choosing music that does not grab your attention (no trash metal), since, at that point, you aren't meditating, you're just listening to music with your eyes closed. White noise is a good contender as well.
- **An alarm** to 'wake' you out of meditation. I set an alarm on my Apple Watch: this alarm only vibrates on my wrist, and is thus gentler than an audio alarm. It has the added advantage of allowing me to de-activate the alarm without getting up or taking off my sleep mask. This allows me to gradually rise out of meditation.
- A set of **reminder objects**, placed on next to the chair you are sitting on. When I am meditating, I will often realize there is something I have forgotten to do, or something I would like to remember — you may recognize this sensation from the shower. When this happens during meditation, I pick up one of the objects and throw or place it on the floor. When I am done meditating, however many minutes later, I will see the object on the floor and remember there was something I needed to remember. Yes, my memory is terrible.

As for the practice of meditation itself (What do you _actually do_?):
- Sit with your eyes closed and try to focus on the visual nothing in front of you.
- As soon as you realize you are thinking about something (which you will, be it an email you need to send, a task you are anxious about, or whatever), gently let go of the thought, and return your focus to the visual nothing.
- If it helps to distract you from your thoughts, you can slowly and silently repeat a phrase. This is known as a 'mantra'. In most traditions of meditation, this is imbued with a sacred meaning or spiritual power. For me, the mantra is simply a way to unfocus my thoughts. The mantra can be any phrase. I use a non-English phrase, since that prevents me from thinking about the meaning of the phrase (the phrase has no meaning to me).

A few final words of advice:
- Do not drink coffee right before meditating, or in the 30 minutes or so preceding it. The caffeine high will cause 'racing thoughts' which will make meditation very difficult.
- 15-20 minutes is, in my experience, an optimal amount of time for meditation. Much shorter may not be useful. Much longer quickly runs into diminishing returns. However, you should take as much time as you need.
- I meditate about once per week. Some people swear by the twice-a-day-for-twenty-minutes TM technique, but I personally found this unsustainable.
- It is okay to meditate only when you feel like you 'really need to'. Do not feel bad for failing to integrate the practice into your daily routine. Rather, view meditation as a tool in your arsenal of self-actualization.
